# Python Crypto Bot (pycryptobot)

## Introduction

I'm a writer on Medium (https://whittle.medium.com). This project is a work in progress and is being documented in a series of articles. If you are interested in keeping up with the progress please do follow me on Medium. This project will cover a variety of concepts from object-oriented programming in Python, working with REST APIs, Pandas data science library for Python, experimental testing and similuations, trading strategies using technical indicators, and crypto currency trading using the Coinbase Pro API. I'm sharing this project with everyone so if you would like to help and contribute or have some good ideas on how to improve it please do get in touch.
