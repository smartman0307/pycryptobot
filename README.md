## Supporting The Project

I get paid to write on Medium. Readers following me, applauding and commenting on my articles, all helps with my earnings. I provided this bot to all of you for free and actively developing it. One way you can support my efforts is to follow me on Medium and read my articles. The Medium subscription is $5 a month (roughly £3) so basically nothing in terms of the value you are getting from the bot. Your efforts here would be greatly appreciated!

Follow me on Medium for updates!

Local repo

    % docker build -t pycryptobot .

## Additional Information

The "requirements.txt" was created with `python3 -m pip freeze`

## Run it

### Manual

    % python3 pycryptobot.py <arguments>

### Docker (Option 1)

    Example Local Absolute Path: /home/example/config.json
    Example Market: BTC-GBP

    Daemon:
    % docker run --name BTC-GBP -v /home/example/config.json:/app/config.json -d ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest <arguments>

    Example:
    % docker run --name BTC-GBP -v /Users/whittlem/Documents/Repos/Docker/config.json:/app/config.json -d ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest --live 0
    e491ae4fdba28aa9e74802895adf5e856006c3c63cf854c657482a6562a1e15

    Interactive:
    % docker run --name BTC-GBP -v /home/example/config.json:/app/config.json -it ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest <arguments>

    List Processes:
    % docker ps

    Example:
    % docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
    e491ae4fdba2   ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest   "python3 pycryptobot…"   46 seconds ago   Up 44 seconds             BTC-GBP

    Container Shell:
    % docker exec -it BTC-GBP /bin/bash
    [root@e491ae4fdba2 app]#

    Build your own image (if necessary):
    docker build -t pycryptobot_BTC-GBP .

    Running the docker image:
    docker run -d --rm --name pycryptobot_BTC-GBP_container pycryptobot_BTC-GBP

Typically I would save all my settings in the config.json but running from the command line I would usually run it like this.

    % python3 pycryptobot.py --market BTC-GBP --granularity 3600 --live 1 --verbose 0 --selllowerpcnt -2

### docker-compose (Option 2)

To run using the config.json in template folder,

    % docker-compose up -d

By default, docker-compose will use the config inside `./market/template`. We provide this as a template for any market config.

For each market you want to trade, create a copy of this folder under market.
Also create either a coinbase.key or binance.key file to each folder depending which trading platform is being used.
For example, if you are trading `BTCEUR` and `ETHEUR` your market folder should look like this:

    ├── market
    │ ├── BTCEUR
    │ │ ├── config.json
    │ │ ├── pycryptobot.log
    │ │ └── graphs
    │ └── ETHEUR
    │   ├── config.json
    │   ├── pycryptobot.log
    │   └── graphs

modify docker-compose.yaml

    version: "3.9"

    services:
      btceur:
        build:
          context: .
        container_name: btceur
        volumes:
          - ./market/BTCEUR/coinbase.key:/app/coinbase.key.json
          - ./market/BTCEUR/config.json:/app/config.json
          - ./market/BTCEUR/pycryptobot.log:/app/pycryptobot.log
          - ./market/BTCEUR/graphs:/app/graphs
          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
        environment:
          - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
        deploy:
          restart_policy:
            condition: on-failure

      etheur:
        build:
          context: .
        container_name: etheur
        volumes:
          - ./market/ETHEUR/coinbase.key:/app/coinbase.key.json
          - ./market/ETHEUR/config.json:/app/config.json
          - ./market/ETHEUR/pycryptobot.log:/app/pycryptobot.log
          - ./market/ETHEUR/graphs:/app/graphs
          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
        environment:
          - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
        deploy:
          restart_policy:
            condition: on-failure

Run all your bots. Note that each market should have it's own config. Graphs will be saved on each market's folder.

    % docker-compose up -d

### Kubernetes (Helm) (Option 3)

There is a helm chart available in this repo. It will create your config.json as a configmap and the binance/coinbase keys as secrets, and mount them into the Pod.
To run pycryptobot as a Kubernetes deployment, create your helm values as yaml in the following format (do not change the path to the api_key_file):

    config: >
        {
            "coinbasepro": {
                "api_url": "https://api.pro.coinbase.com",
                "config": {
                    "base_currency": "ETH",
                    "quote_currency": "EUR",
                    "live": 1,
                    "sellatloss": 0,
                    "disablelog": 1,
                    "autorestart": 1
                },
                "api_key_file": "/app/keys/coinbasepro.key"
            },
            "telegram" : {
                "token" : "<telegram_token>",
                "client_id" : "<client_id>",
            }
        }

    coinbasepro_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        zzzzzzzzzzzz

Or, for binance:

    config: >
        {
            "binance": {
                "api_url": "https://api.binance.com",
                "config": {
                    "base_currency": "ETH",
                    "quote_currency": "EUR",
                    "live": 1,
                    "sellatloss": 0,
                    "disablelog": 1,
                    "autorestart": 1
                },
                "api_key_file": "/app/keys/binance.key"
            },
            "telegram" : {
                "token" : "<telegram_token>",
                "client_id" : "<client_id>",
            }
        }

    binance_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Or, for kucoin:

    config: >
        {
            "kucoin": {
                "api_url": "https://api.kucoin.com",
                "config": {
                    "base_currency": "ETH",
                    "quote_currency": "EUR",
                    "live": 1,
                    "sellatloss": 0,
                    "disablelog": 1,
                    "autorestart": 1
                },
                "api_key_file": "/app/keys/coinbasepro.key"
            },
            "telegram" : {
                "token" : "<telegram_token>",
                "client_id" : "<client_id>",
            }
        }

    kucoin_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        zzzzzzzzzzzz

Or both:

    config: >
        {
            "coinbasepro": {
                "api_url": "https://api.pro.coinbase.com",
                "config": {
                    "base_currency": "ETH",
                    "quote_currency": "EUR",
                    "live": 1,
                    "sellatloss": 0,
                    "disablelog": 1,
                    "autorestart": 1
                },
                "api_key_file": "/app/keys/coinbasepro.key"
            },
            "binance": {
                "api_url": "https://api.binance.com",
                "config": {
                    "base_currency": "ETH",
                    "quote_currency": "EUR",
                    "live": 1,
                    "sellatloss": 0,
                    "disablelog": 1,
                    "autorestart": 1
                },
                "api_key_file": "/app/keys/binance.key"
            },
            "kucoin": {
                "api_url": "https://api.kucoin.com",
                "config": {
                    "base_currency": "ETH",
                    "quote_currency": "EUR",
                    "live": 1,
                    "sellatloss": 0,
                    "disablelog": 1,
                    "autorestart": 1
                },
                "api_key_file": "/app/keys/kucoin.key"
            },
            "telegram" : {
                "token" : "<telegram_token>",
                "client_id" : "<client_id>",
            }
        }

    coinbasepro_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        zzzzzzzzzzzz
    binance_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
    kucoin_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        zzzzzzzzzzzz

Then run:

    git clone https://github.com/whittlem/pycryptobot
    cd pycryptobot/chart
    helm upgrade -i pycryptobot-eth-eur -f <path_to_helm_config>

So if you created above helm values file as config-eth-eur.yaml, you would run:

    helm upgrade -i pycryptobot-eth-eur -f config-eth-eur.yaml

## Bot mechanics

Smart switching:

* If the EMA12 is greater than the EMA26 on the 1 hour and 6 hour intervals switch to start trading on the 15 minute intervals
* If the EMA12 is lower than the EMA26 on the 1 hour and 6 hour intervals switch back to trade on the 1 hour intervals
* If a "granularity" is specified as an argument or in the config.json then smart switching will be disabled
* Force smart switching between 1 hour and 15 minute intervals with "smartswitch" argument or config option (1 or 0)

Buy signal:

* EMA12 is currently crossing above the EMA26 and MACD is above the Signal *OR* MACD is currently crossing above the Signal and EMA12 is above the EMA26
* Golden Cross (SMA50 is above the SMA200) <-- bull market detection
* On-Balance Volume Percent > -5 <-- suitable momentum required
* Elder Ray Buy is True <-- bull market detection

The bot will only trade in a bull market to minimise losses! (you can disable this)

Special buy cases:

* "nobuynearhighpcnt" to specify the percentage from high that the bot should not buy if "disablebuynearhigh" is not specified.
* "buymaxsize" specifies a fixed max amount of the quote currency to buy with.
* "buylastsellsize" when enabled, bot will buy the same size as the last sell size for the current market.
* "trailingbuypcnt" specifies the percentage for the price to increase before placing buy order after receiving buy signal
        The default percentage is 0%.  If the price drops after receiving buy signal, the bot will automatically follow the price
        down and watch for it to have a positive percentage.  You are able to adjust this to any number above zero that you would 
        like to see as an increase before buying.  Many times the price falls below zero right after a buy signal is received.
* "marketmultibuycheck" when enabled, bot will perform an additional check on base and quote balance to prevent multiple buys.
        It has been determined that some market pairs have problem API responses which can create a multiple buy issue.
        Please Note:  "marketmultibuycheck" will conflict with configurations that use "sellpercent".

Sell signal:

* EMA12 is currently crossing below the EMA26
* MACD is below the Signal

Special sell cases:

* "nosellminpcnt" specifies the lower margin limit to not sell above
* "nosellmaxpcnt" specifies the upper margin limit to not sell below
* If "sellatloss" is on, bot will sell if price drops below the lower Fibonacci band
* If "sellatloss" is on and "selllowerpcnt" is specified the bot will sell at the specified amount E.g. -2 for -2% margin
* If "sellatloss" is on and "trailingstoploss" is specified the bot will sell at the specified amount below the buy high
* If "sellupperpcnt" is specified the bot will sell at the specified amount E.g. 10 for 10% margin (Depending on the conditions I lock in profit at 3%)
* If the margin exceeds 3% and the price reaches a Fibonacci band it will sell to lock in profit
* If the margin exceeds 3% but a strong reversal is detected with negative OBV and MACD < Signal it will sell
* "sellatloss" set to 0 prevents selling at a loss

## Optional Options

    --stats                             Display order profit and loss (P&L) report
    --autorestart                       Automatically restart the bot on error
    --sellatresistance                  Sells if the price reaches either resistance or Fibonacci band
    --enabletelegrambotcontrol          Enable bot control via Telegram
    --sell_smart_switch                 Enables smart switching to 5 minute granularity after a buy is placed
    --enableinsufficientfundslogging    Stop insufficient fund errors from stopping the bot, instead log and continue

    --disablebuynearhigh                Disable buying within 3% of the dataframe high
    --disablebuymacd                    Disable macd buy signal
    --disablebuyema                     Disable ema buy signal.If both core indicators ema and macd buy signals are disabled, bot won't buy.Doesn't affect sell strategy.
    --disablebuyobv                     Disable obv buy signal
    --disablebuyelderray                Disable elder ray buy signal

    --disablefailsafelowerpcnt          Disable failsafe sell on 'selllowerpcnt'
    --disableprofitbankupperpcnt        Disable profit bank on 'sellupperpcnt'
    --disableprofitbankfibonaccihigh    Disable profit bank on fibonacci upper band
    --disableprofitbankreversal         Disable profit bank on strong candlestick reversal
    --disabletelegram                   Disable sending telegram messages

    --telegramtradesonly                Toggle only sending trade messages to telegram - won't send smart switch and last action messages, will still send error messages unless disabling separately
    --disablelog                        Disable writing log entries
    --disabletracker                    Disable saving CSV on buy and sell events

## "Sell At Loss" explained

The "sellatloss" option disabled has it's advantages and disadvantages. It does prevent any losses but also prevents you from exiting a market before a crash or bear market. Sometimes it's better to make an occasional small loss and make it up with several buys than be conservative and potentially lock a trade for weeks if not months. It happened to me while testing this with the last crash (after Elon's tweet!). Three of my bots did not sell while the profit dropped to -10 to -20%. It did bounce back and I made over 3% a trade with any losses but I also lost out of loads of trading opportunities. It's really a matter of preference. Maybe some markets would be more appropriate than others for this.

## Live Trading

In order to trade live you need to authenticate with the Coinbase Pro or Binance APIs. This is all documented in my Medium articles. In summary you will need to include a config.json file in your project root which contains your API keys. If the file does not exist it will only work in test/demo mode.

## Trading Simulation

    --sim ['fast, fast-sample, slow-sample']   Sets simulation mode
    --simstartdate                             Start date for sample simulation e.g '2021-01-15'
    --simenddate                               End date for sample simulation or 'now'

`simstartdate` takes priority over `simenddate` if both are given

### Simulation trades.csv

By default, when running a simulation, if there are any orders,  a file called `trades.csv` with all BUYS and SELLS will be created.

With `--tradesfile` you can control the name and where file is stored, eg `--tradesfile BTSUDC-trades.csv`

## API key / secret / password storage

From now on it's recommended NOT to store the credentials in the config file because people share configs and may inadvertently share their API keys within.

Instead, please, create `binance.key` or `coinbase.key` or `kucoin.key` (or use your own names for the files) and refer to these files in the `config.json` file as:

    "api_key_file" : "binance.key"

Once you have done that, "api_key" and "api_secret" can be safely removed from your config file and you're free to share your configs without worrying of leaked credentials.

You may also specify API key file with a command line argument like:

    --api_key_file binance.key

### binance.key / conbase.key / kucoin.key examples

Actually it's pretty simple, these files are supposed to be a simple text files with the API key on the first line, API secret on the second line and in case of coinbase and kucoin, probably the API password on the third. No comments or anything else is allowed, just the long string of numbers:

    0234238792873423...82736827638472
    68473847745876abscd9872...8237642

(dots are used to indicate places where the strings were shortened)

## config.json examples

Coinbase Pro basic (using smart switching)

    {
        "api_url" : "https://api.pro.coinbase.com",
        "api_key_file" : "coinbase.key",
        "config" : {

                "verbose" : 0
            }
        }
    }

All the "config" options in the config.json can be passed as arguments E.g. --market <market>

Command line arguments override config.json config.

For telegram, add a piece to the config.json as follows:

    "telegram" : {
        "token" : "<token>",
        "user_Id" : "<user id>" 
        "client_id" : "<client id>"
    }

You can use @botfather and @myidbot in telegram to create a bot with token and get a client id.

For configuring the volume scanner, add a piece to the config.json as follows:

    "scanner" : {
		"atr72_pcnt" : <float> # default 2.0,
		"enableexitaftersell" : 1, # once a bot has sold it will exit
		"enableleverage" : 0, # allow leverage markets from the scanner to start
		"maxbotcount" : <int>, # maximum amount of bots you want running at once
		"autoscandelay": <hours>, # number of hours you want to wait between scans
	}

For configuring logger, add a piece to the config.json as follows:
*This is also default configuration of the logger, if no config is given and log is not disabled this configuration will apply.*

    "logger" : {
        "filelog": 1,
        "logfile": "pycryptobot.log",
        "fileloglevel": "DEBUG",
        "consolelog": 1,
        "consoleloglevel": "INFO"
    }

"filelog" and "consolelog" can only get 1 (enable) or 0 (disable).
"--disablelog" argument or "disablelog" config will disable to writing logfile as backwards compatibility.
If you want to disable logging entirely, you can set "filelog" and "consolelog" to 0.

"logfile" is overridden by '--logfile' console argument.
If '--logfile' used when running bot "logfile": "pycryptobot.log" line in config file will be ignored.

"fileloglevel" and "consoleloglevel" can get one of 'CRITICAL', 'ERROR', 'WARNING', 'INFO', 'DEBUG', 'NOTSET'
For further detail in log levels: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels>

## Multi-Market Trading

The bot can trade multiple markets at once. This is also documented in my Medium articles. The bot will execute buys using the full "quote currency" balance it has access too and it will sell the full "base currency" balance it has access too. In order to ring-fence your non-bot funds you should create another "Portfolio" in Coinbase Pro and assign API keys to it. That way you limit exposure. You can so something similar with Binance using sub-accounts but I believe you need to be a certain level to do this.

The way you trade multiple markets at once is create multiple Coinbase Pro portfolios for each each bot instance. You will then clone this project for additional bots with the relevant Portfolio keys (config.json).

I have 5 bots running at once for my Portfolios: "Bot - BTC-GBP", "Bot - BCH-GBP", "Bot - ETH-GBP", "Bot - LTC-GBP", and "Bot - XLM-EUR".

Assuming each bot has a config.json that looks similar to this (update the "cryptoMarket" and "fiatMarket" appropriately):

    {
        "api_url" : "https://api.pro.coinbase.com",
        "api_key_file" : "coinbase.key"
        "config" : {
            "cryptoMarket" : "BTC",
            "fiatMarket" : "GBP",
            "live" : 1
            "selllowerpcnt" : -2
        }
    }

The way I run my five bots is as follow:

    BTC-GBP % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

    BCH-GBP % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

    ETH-GBP % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

    LTC-GBP % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

    XLM-EUR % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

Notice how I don't pass any arguments. It's all retrieved from the config.json but you can pass the arguments manually as well.

## The merge from "binance" branch back into "main"

Some of you may have been helping test the new code for a few months in the "binance" branch. This is now merged back into the "main" branch. If you are still using the "binance" branch please carry out the following steps (per bot instance).

    git reset --hard
    git checkout main
    git pull
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Please note you need to be using Python 3.9.x or greater. The previous bot version only required Python 3.x.

## Stats Module

To keep track of the bots performance over time you can run the stats module. e.g.

    python3 pycryptobot.py --stats

This will analyse all the completed buy/sell trade pairs to give stats on todays trades, the trades over the last 7 days, the trades over the last 30 days, and all-time trades.

An optional flag of --statstartdate can be given to ignore all trades that happened before a specified date. The date must be of the format: yyyy-mm-dd. e.g.

    python3 pycryptobot.py --stats --statstartdate 2021-6-01

To get the stats from all your bots, another optional flag of --statgroup can be used. This takes a list of markets and merges the results into one output. e.g.

    python3 pycryptobot.py --stats --statgroup BTCGBP ETHGBP ADAGBP

or via the config.json file e.g.

    "config": {
        ....
        "stats": 1,
        "statgroup": ["BTCGBP", "ETHGBP", "ADAGBP"],
        ....
    }
Note: --statgroup only accepts a group of markets if the quote currency (in this example GBP) is the same.

If you want more detail than the simple summary, add the optional flag --statdetail. This will print a more detailed list of the transactions.
--statdetail can work in conjunction with --statstartdate and --statgroup.

## Upgrading the bots

I push updates regularly and it's best to always be running the latest code. In each bot directory make sure you run this regularly.

    git pull

I've actually included this in the examples in how to start the bot that will do this for you automatically.

## Fun quick non-live demo

    python3 pycryptobot.py --market BTC-GBP --granularity 3600 --sim fast --verbose 0

If you get stuck with anything email me or raise an issue in the repo and I'll help you sort it out. Raising an issue is probably better as the question and response may help others.

Enjoy and happy trading! :)
